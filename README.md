# Standard-deviation-c-sharp-vs-asm
Desktop app that calculates standard deviation. User can choose how it is going to be calculated. It can be calculated in two ways. First, executing code written in C#, and second, using code written in assembly. User can compare the time needed to complete the calculations for each way. 

To provide input data, user selects a file - each number is in separate line, comma is the decimal separator. 

The results (execution time, standard deviation) are shown in the table.

Execution time strongly depends on the used processor.
